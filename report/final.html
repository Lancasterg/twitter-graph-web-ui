                <p>
                    This project aims to visualise relationships between Twitter users. By entering a Twitter username,
                    recent tweets from that user are downloaded and input into a graph database for processing. This
                    allows us to apply algorithms like PageRank to gain a richer understanding of the relationships
                    in the social network. After querying the database, relationships are plotted in an easily
                    interpretable and interactive graph on the client side.
                </p>

                <h2>HTML: <code>A+</code></h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire website consists of a single dynamically generated HTML page (a so-called
                    "single-page application"). We use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> as the core framework
                    to generate the page and load/unload components as the user interacts with the site. We like this
                    idea, as it means that the user's browser never needs to load additional HTML pages - everything is
                    handled on the client side through dynamic JavaScript. It also means that the application can be
                    written in a logical and hierarchical way, with a top-level parent component aggregating a tree
                    of sub-components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vue.js starts off by bootstrapping an almost empty HTML page, containing only headers (title,
                    meta tags, favicon and script tags). It looks for the sole
                    <code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag and modifies the DOM on-the-fly, replacing it
                    with a dynamically generated DOM tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Vue.js component is quite unique. It uses special <code>.vue</code> files, which contain a
                    HTML template, a JavaScript controller class, and a CSS style block. While some would argue that
                    these three concerns should be strictly separated and hence live in separate files, Vue.js argues
                    that since components should be small and coherent anyway, it is actually better to keep these
                    things together to avoid having to waste time searching through e.g. a large CSS file to find the
                    style for a particular component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site currently comprises three main components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>HomeComponent</code> is the top-level parent component, which is bound to the root
                        URL i.e. <code>/</code>. Its job is to house the other components.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <code>SearchComponent</code> controls the username search bar at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>The <code>GraphComponent</code> controls the main SVG-based node relationship graph. It watches
                        for changes from the <code>SearchComponent</code> and reloads the graph as necessary.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    We have become very proficient with the Vue.js framework. Since the preliminary version, we have
                    also implemented an additional component, the <code>UserInfoComponent</code>, which displays an
                    information box at the top left of the page showing details about the currently selected Twitter
                    user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a side note, this report itself comprises a significant amount of HTML code. Do we get points
                    for that? :)
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4 text-justify">
                <h2>CSS: <code>A</code></h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use the popular open-source <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
                    framework as our base CSS library since it is relatively simple to use yet still powerful enough
                    for our needs. We wanted a dark, minimalist feel to the site, so we made use of a free and
                    open-source <a
                        href="https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-themes/demo/neon-glow/">template </a>
                    that gave us the general look we were aiming for, before adding our own customisations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We intentionally used CSS to make the main node graph fill the entire screen. We used an absolute
                    positioning and 100% width/height method to achieve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made a custom loading spinner using pure CSS animations (affectionately named HAL 9000, after the
                    evil robot from 2001: A Space Odyssey). This is used when loading tweets from the server. Check
                    him out!
                </p>
                <div class="loading-spinner mb-4"
                     style="text-align: center; position: relative; background-color: #0c0d16; padding: 20px;">
                    <div class="hal-9000"></div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Vue.js provides some very nice features when it comes to CSS. As mentioned previously, a
                    component can be styled in an isolated manner through the use of a style block in the component's
                    <code>.vue</code> file. These styles are <i>scoped to the component</i>, meaning that one can write
                    <code>p { color: red; }</code> and it will <i>only</i> affect paragraph tags inside that component.
                    Very useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vue.js also allows CSS files to be "imported" via JavaScript. This means that e.g. Bootstrap's CSS
                    can be included simply by running <code>npm install bootstrap</code> and then using <code>import
                    "bootstrap.css"</code> in the parent component. Vue.js will create the <code>&lt;link /&gt;</code>
                    tag automatically and include it in the generated HTML file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have also made a number of other CSS tweaks to make things look nice, such as using a blurred
                    version of the user's profile picture as a background on the user info box. This gives a nice
                    visual continuity effect to the page.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4 text-justify">
                <h2>JS: <code>A+</code></h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned previously, Vue.js generates HTML via client-side JavaScript. Our app uses a number of
                    Vue components, which comprise a number of JavaScript functions, plus HTML and CSS chunks for the
                    component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>GraphComponent</code> is the most interesting from a JavaScript perspective. It is
                    responsible for reacting to changes in the username search bar (via a two-way binding mechanism)
                    or to clicks on graph nodes.
                    On change, the component sets a variable which displays the loading spinner, then makes an
                    asynchronous call to the backend to fetch data. Following that, it initialises the actual node
                    graph itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The node graph has been implemented using the <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> library, a
                    powerful library for creating SVG-based visualisations. We separated out the implementation of
                    the D3.js node graph from the Vue.js component into <code>d3-graph.js</code> in a
                    framework-agnostic manner. It is a vanilla ES6 class, and essentially forms the heart of the
                    website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>d3-graph.js</code> wraps a D3.js <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-force">force-directed
                    graph</a>. Its constructor takes the ID of a HTML element to bind to, and a list of nodes and
                    edges that will make up the graph. On initialisation, it begins to use the D3.js SVG API to
                    dynamically create SVG elements on the page. A number of methods are exposed to allow the caller to
                    supply callback functions for specific events, such as mouseover events on nodes and edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graph has been created to support several features such as zooming, panning, dragging and
                    mouse hover events. Node radii and edge widths are computed based upon properties of the node graph,
                    such as in-degree and out-degree. Clicking on a node will result in a new search being
                    performed, with the clicked user becoming the focus of the graph. The graph will also dynamically
                    resize itself as the window size changes, meaning it will work on any screen size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graph (and the website in general) has been tested on Chrome and Firefox. Support for Firefox
                    was a little tricky, since it has some quirky behaviour when reporting div sizes during window
                    resize events.
                </p>
                <!--<p>-->
                <!--In the near future we would like to implement live graph updates, dynamically inserting new nodes-->
                <!--into the graph as activity happens on Twitter.-->

                <h2>PNG: <code>A</code></h2>
                <p>
                    Our PNG work comprises three main aspects: a custom University of Bristol logo used as a subtle
                    backdrop to the node graph, a mashup of the Twitter and Neo4J database logos used as a favicon, and
                    Twitter user avatars displayed on graph nodes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To create the University of Bristol logo, a JPEG version was taken (shown below on the left) and
                    modified to our needs using GIMP. Firstly, we added an alpha channel to allow having a
                    transparent background. Then we used the magic wand tool to select and remove all the portions of
                    white background in the image, which was a fairly detailed operation. Following that, the colour
                    was inverted to produce a white image, and the edges were trimmed to bring the graphic exactly to
                    the edges of the canvas. The finished image (shown below on the right) is positioned in the centre
                    of the window with a 5% opacity to give a nice subtle look.
                </p>
                <div style="background-color: #8c8c8c; padding: 10px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">

                <p>
                    A favicon for the website was created by merging the <a
                        href="https://neo4j.com/style-guide/">Neo4j</a> and <a
                        href="https://about.twitter.com/en_gb/company/brand-resources.html">Twitter</a>
                    logos into one. To create the effect of the graph 'wrapping' around the bird, GIMP was used to
                    create three layers; two for the Twitter bird on the top and bottom layers and one for the Neo4j
                    graph sandwiched between them. The body of the bird on the top layer was deleted, to make the
                    graph underneath visible. Additionally, the colours of the green and white dots were changed
                    to be brighter, and therefore stand out more when used as a favicon. To create the favicon, the
                    image was scaled down to 16x16px, with many of the pixels manually edited to make it appear as close
                    to the original image as possible.

                </p>

                <p>
                    To give a sense of identity and colour to the application, we also decided to use the Twitter user's
                    avatar inside the graph nodes themselves. These are loaded from the
                    <code><a href="https://twivatar.glitch.me/">twivatar</a></code> API.

                <h2>SVG: <code>A</code></h2>
                <p>
                    We rated this section <code>A</code> because there was a lot of work involved in figuring out how
                    D3.js generated SVG paths, and how to control it to get the behaviour we wanted. The main body of
                    our site is in fact <i>one big interactive SVG</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the D3.js API, we modified many aspects of the SVGs such as stroke colour and width, node
                    radii, node fill, click/hover/zoom handlers etc. A major challenge was making the user avatars
                    (which are retrieved as rectangles) into a circular shape, and scaling them correctly to fit
                    inside the node based on its size (which is derived from the user's "social importance" in
                    the graph). This was achieved using a uniquely identified <code>defs</code> element and
                    corresponding <code>clipPath</code> element for each user avatar to define the image resource and
                    its desired clipped shape. These are then associated with an <code>image</code> element by ID and
                    <code>transform</code>-ed into the centre of the parent element to produce the desired effect.

                <p>
                    The web server is based on Express.js. We chose this as it fairly minimalistic, and allowed us to
                    start development quickly. Our application is an SPA, which means that the web server acts as a
                    REST API serving data to the browser (or potentially other clients such as a mobile app). The only
                    exception to this is the index page, which is served as HTML. The production version of the web
                    server has been deployed to the Oracle cloud. Since no sensitive data is sent from the browser to
                    the web server, and the it does not require authentication, we did not consider it necessary to
                    configure HTTPS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Twitter API provides a set of function calls that enables access to the Twitter service
                    programmatically. To use the service, a set of developer keys are required for authentication, and
                    each key is limited to x requests every thirty minutes. The authentication credentials are stored
                    in a text file that is not accessible through the web server. Calls to the Twitter API are
                    performed over TLS by the web server.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, entering a username on the front-end returns a graph structure that displays the mentions
                    of that particular user. The main function of our server is to fetch data from the Twitter API,
                    store it in the database, and then return the results to the client. In order to do this, the <code>
                    retrieveTweets </code> function contains a very complex promise resolution hierarchy to get nested
                    levels of user mentions. The depth of the hierarchy is configurable, and works using a recursive
                    method.The <code>retrieveTweets </code> function uses an
                    array of promises, that only resolves when the data for all users at the current depth level have
                    been retrieved. The function then recursively calls itself, and retrieves all users mentioned by the
                    previous user. To allow for the data to be plotted once it has been retrieved from the database, it
                    has been wrangled into a format recognised by the D3.js library used on the front-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to limited requests, the Twitter API can sometimes take up to 15 seconds to retrieve
                    data. To ensure an uninterrupted service, we have implemented caching to reduce the number of calls
                    made using the Twitter API. This has been done in the <code> checkCache </code> function, that
                    checks if the user has had their data pulled from Twitter in the past 24 hours. If they have, then
                    the data is returned from the database without using the Twitter service, thus reducing the usage of
                    the API.

                <p>
                    We used a Neo4j graph database to store the relationships found on Twitter in a network of nodes,
                    edges and properties. It was chosen as it stores data in much the same way as we planned to
                    display the results on the webpage. Unlike some NoSQL databases, Neo4j has its own querying language
                    called Cypher, that allows us to read and write data similarly to an SQL database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neo4J has an algorithms library that allows for the calculation of properties such as betweenness
                    centrality, closeness centrality and more typical algorithms like PageRank. The benefit of using
                    this library is that it performs all computation on the database, and returns a result without any
                    code having been written by the programmer. We use the algorithms library to find the users with the
                    highest importance in the subset of all Twitter users entered into our database. These are
                    represented visually as the size of the node in the displayed graph (bigger node = higher
                    importance).
                </p>
                <p>
                    An embedded version of the database is bundled with the application, which weighs about 100MB.
                    From a security perspective, the default listen address is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and we wrote a
                    startup script that changes the default username and password to a secure string. This means that
                    for local operation, the database is secure. The username and password are stored in plaintext on
                    disk, which is not ideal, but acceptable for local operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The production application uses a hosted version of Neo4J in the Oracle cloud, which is configured
                    to allow access only from the machine on which the backend is hosted (also in the Oracle
                    cloud). The cloud platform provides a dynamic networking feature which means that even if the IP
                    address of either machine changes, the application will still operate in a secure manner. The
                    username and password of the production database are different to the embedded version, but they
                    are also stored in plaintext in a config file on the backend server. This is obviously not ideal,
                    but as it is not possible to access this text file through the web server, the database is secure
                    to a degree. The database server has been further configured to require TLS client connections
                    from the backend to ensure credentials are transmitted over a secure connection.

                    The heart of our website, the D3.js node graph, is dynamically populated with data loaded
                    asynchronously from the backend. We created a REST API which takes a set of query parameters and
                    fetches the required data from the Twitter API. You can see the REST API in action
                    <a href="http://129.213.158.149:4000/tweets?username=alan">here</a>.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">axios</a> library to handle AJAX calls to
                    the backend. Axios provides a clean and simple Promise-based interface, and integrates very
                    nicely with Vue.js (which also promotes the use of promises).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user searches for a Twitter username, a <code>GET</code> request is made to the
                    REST API and a Promise object is created. When the request is complete, the promise is resolved and
                    the data is passed to the node graph, which uses it to reinitialise itself and redraw the graph.

                    The main aim of this project was to use a variety of web technologies to create an
                    application to visualise the relationships between Twitter users in an interactive graph. To meet
                    this aim, we implemented three central features:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A search bar, allowing for data to be retrieved for any Twitter user;</li>
                    <li>An interactive graph mapping the relationships of the chosen user with other users, where a
                        larger node indicates a larger amount of communication between the two users;
                    </li>
                    <li>A pop-up box that showing information about a user when a node is selected.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We are particularly proud of the overall aesthetics of our application. We spent a lot of time
                    tweaking the CSS to make it look and feel the way we wanted. We think the overall effect looks
                    quite professional and polished, given the fact that neither of us were particularly experienced
                    with web technologies at the beginning of this assignment. We feel that we have put a lot of hard
                    work into the application, having each spent several weeks on it.
                </p>

                <h3>Graph algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    The heart of our application is the Twitter user node graph. This section explains our work on
                    the graph processing elements of the application in more depth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our application, the size of a node is determined by
                    its 'node centrality'. This is a metric that identifies how
                    important a node is, based on its degree, i.e. the number of incoming and outgoing links it has.
                    For a Twitter user, the number of links are based on the number of times a user has mentioned
                    another user in a tweet. In the context of our application, the importance of a node is
                    represented by its size. The figure below illustrates this concept.
                </p>
                <div style="width:100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px;">

                    <img style="width: 250px; height: 250px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center"
                         src="../src/assets/images/graph.png"/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The figure above represents the "node centrality" algorithm. There are many other graph
                    algorithms that calculate other properties, which could potentially also be exported to give
                    insights into the relationships between Twitter users. Given more time to work on the project, we
                    would probably go into even greater depth on the database side
                    and explore how we could visualise the results of the different graph search algorithms.
                    Currently we only use the node centrality algorithm, but we would like to explore methods to
                    visualise more advanced algorithms.
                </p>

                <h3>Further work</h3>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allow for the depth of the relationships to be configurable on the
                    front-end. However, as the Twitter API restricts the number of requests to 180 every fifteen
                    minutes, a depth greater than 5 causes the request limit to be reached quickly, even after
                    using database caching. This problem could be resolved by using Twitter's premium API to
                    increase the rate limit, however the lowest cost for this is $149/month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another potential extension would be to implement hashtag searching. This would work in much the
                    same
                    way as the current user search, but it will retrieve and display all users who have recently
                    tweeted a given hashtag. Given enough time, we may also try to update the mentions in real-time,
                    however this involves switching from the current Twitter API to the streaming API.
