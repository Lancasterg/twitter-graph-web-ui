                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This project aims to visualise the relationships between Twitter users. By entering a username,
                    a Twitter users post history is downloaded and input into a graph database for processing. This
                    allows us to apply algorithms like PageRank to gain a richer understanding of the relationships
                    in the social network. After querying the database, relationships are plotted in an easily
                    interpretable and interactive graph on the client side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4 text-justify">
                <h2>HTML: <code>A</code></h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire website consists of a single dynamically generated HTML page (a so-called
                    "single-page application"). We use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> as the core framework
                    to generate the page and load/unload components as the user interacts with the site. We like this
                    idea, as it means that the user's browser never needs to load additional HTML pages - everything is
                    handled on the client side through dynamic JavaScript. It also means that the application can be
                    written in a logical and hierarchical way, with a top-level parent component aggregating a tree
                    of sub-components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vue.js starts off by bootstrapping an almost empty HTML page, containing only headers (title,
                    meta tags, favicon and script tags). It looks for the sole
                    <code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag and modifies the DOM on-the-fly, replacing it
                    with a dynamically generated DOM tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Vue.js component is quite unique. It uses special <code>.vue</code> files, which contain a
                    HTML template, a JavaScript controller class, and a CSS style block. While some would argue that
                    these three concerns should be strictly separated and hence live in separate files, Vue.js argues
                    that since components should be small and coherent anyway, it is actually better to keep these
                    things together to avoid having to e.g. search through a large CSS file to find the style for a
                    particular component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site currently comprises three main components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>HomeComponent</code> is the top-level parent component, which is bound to the root
                        URL i.e. <code>/</code>. Its job is to house the other components.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <code>SearchComponent</code> controls the username search bar at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>The <code>GraphComponent</code> watches for changes from the <code>SearchComponent</code> and
                        reloads the main SVG-based node relationship graph.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    We have already become very proficient with the Vue.js framework. However, for the final version
                    we plan to include even more dynamic HTML components, such as Twitter user profile pages and
                    components to search and select different types of relationships such as followers and hashtags.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This report itself comprises a significant amount of HTML code. Do we get points for that? :)
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4 text-justify">
                <h2>CSS: <code>A</code></h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use the popular open-source <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
                    framework as our base CSS library since it is relatively simple to use yet still powerful enough
                    for our needs. We wanted a dark, minimalist feel to the site, so we made use of a free and
                    open-source <a
                        href="https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-themes/demo/neon-glow/">template </a>
                    that gave us the general look we were aiming for, before adding our own customisations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We intentionally used CSS to make the main graph fill the entire screen. We used an absolute
                    positioning and 100% width/height method to achieve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made a custom loading spinner using pure CSS animations (affectionately named HAL 9000, after the
                    evil robot from 2001: A Space Odyssey). This is used when loading tweets from the server. Check
                    him out!
                </p>
                <div class="loading-spinner mb-4" style="text-align: center; position: relative">
                    <div class="hal-9000"></div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Vue.js provides some very nice features when it comes to CSS. As mentioned previously, a
                    component can be styled in an isolated manner through the use of a style block in the component's
                    <code>.vue</code> file. These styles are <i>scoped to the component</i>, meaning that one can write
                    <code>p { color: red; }</code> and it will <i>only</i> affect paragraph tags inside that component.
                    Very useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vue.js also allows CSS files to be "imported" via JavaScript. This means that e.g. Bootstrap's CSS
                    can be included simply by running <code>npm install bootstrap</code> and then using <code>import
                    "bootstrap.css"</code> in the parent component. Vue.js will create the <code>&lt;link /&gt;</code>
                    tag automatically and include it in the generated HTML file.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="mb-4 text-justify">
                <h2>JS: <code>A</code></h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned previously, Vue.js generates HTML via client-side JavaScript. Our app uses a number of
                    Vue components, which comprise a number of JavaScript functions, plus HTML and CSS chunks for the
                    component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>GraphComponent</code> is the most interesting from a JavaScript perspective. It is
                    responsible for reacting to changes in the username search bar, via a two-way binding mechanism.
                    On change, the component sets a variable which displays the loading spinner, then makes an
                    asynchronous call to the backend to fetch data. Following that, it initialises the actual node
                    graph itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The node graph has been implemented using the <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> library, a
                    powerful library for creating SVG-based visualisations. We separated out the implementation of
                    the D3.js node graph from the Vue.js component into <code>d3-graph.js</code> in a
                    framework-agnostic manner. It is a vanilla ES6 class, and essentially forms the heart of the
                    website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>d3-graph.js</code> wraps a D3.js <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-force">force-directed
                    graph</a>. Its constructor takes the ID of a HTML element to bind to, and a list of nodes and
                    edges that will make up the graph. On initialisation, it begins to use the D3.js SVG API to
                    dynamically create SVG elements on the page. A number of methods are exposed to allow the caller to
                    supply callback functions for specific events, such as mouseover events on nodes and edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graph has been created to support several features such as zooming, panning, dragging and
                    mouse hover events.
                    Node radii and edge widths are computed based upon properties of the node graph, such as
                    in-degree and out-degree. The graph will also dynamically resize itself as the window size
                    changes, meaning it will work on any screen size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graph (and the website in general) has been tested on Chrome and Firefox. Support for Firefox
                    was a little tricky, since it has some quirky behaviour when reporting div sizes during window
                    resize events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the near future we would like to implement live graph updates, dynamically inserting new nodes
                    into the graph as activity happens on Twitter.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    We rated this section <code>A</code> because there was a lot of work involved in figuring out how
                    D3.js generated SVG paths, and how to control it to get the behaviour we wanted. The main body of
                    our site is in fact one big interactive SVG.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we expect the feedback to suggest that we manually create static SVG images using e.g.
                    Inkscape. This is something we plan to do in the near future.

                <p>
                    The web server is based on express, which is a web application framework for Node.js. We chose
                    express as it fairly minimalistic, and allowed us to start development quickly. The server has been
                    deployed on Oracle cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Twitter API provides a set of function calls that enables access to the Twitter service
                    programmatically. To use the service, a set of developer keys are required for authentication, and
                    each key is limited to x requests every thirty minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, entering a username on the front-end returns a graph structure that displays the mentions
                    of that particular user. The main function of our server is to fetch data from the Twitter API,
                    store it in the database, and then return the results to the client. In order to do this, the <code>
                    retrieveTweets </code> function contains a very complex promise resolution hierarchy to get nested
                    levels of user mentions. The depth of the hierarchy is currently constant, however we plan to allow
                    for this to be configurable on the front-end. The <code> retrieveTweets </code> function uses an
                    array of promises, that only resolves when the data for all users at the current depth level have
                    been retrieved. The function then recursively calls itself, and retrieves all users mentioned by the
                    previous user. To allow for the data to be plotted once it has been retrieved from the database, it
                    has been wrangled into a format recognised by the D3.js library used on the front-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to limited requests, the Twitter API can sometimes take up to 15 seconds to retrieve
                    data. To ensure an uninterrupted service, we have implemented caching to reduce the number of calls
                    made using the Twitter API. This has been done in the <code> checkCache </code> function, that
                    checks if the user has had their data pulled from Twitter in the past 24 hours. If they have, then
                    the data is returned from the database without using the Twitter service, thus reducing the usage of
                    the API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the final version, we plan to implement hashtag searching. This would work in much the same
                    way as the current user search, but it will retrieve and display all users who have recently
                    tweeted a given hashtag. Given enough time, we may also try to update the mentions in real-time,
                    however this involves switching from the current Twitter API to the streaming API. Although the
                    server has been deployed on Oracle cloud, it does not yet use https.

            <div class="mb-4 text-justify">
                <h2>Database: <code>A</code></h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Neo4j graph database to store the relationships found on Twitter in a network of nodes,
                    edges and properties. It was chosen as it stores data in much the same way as we planned to
                    display the results on the webpage. Unlike some NoSQL databases, Neo4j has its own querying language
                    called Cypher, that allows us to read and write data similarly to an SQL database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although not yet used in this project, Neo4J has an algorithms library that allows for the
                    calculation of betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and more typical algorithms like
                    PageRank. The benefit of using this library is that it performs all computation on the database, and
                    returns a result without any code having been written by the programmer. We plan to use the
                    algorithms library to find the users with the highest importance in the subset of all Twitter users
                    entered into our database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The database is currently embedded, however we have written bash scripts to deploy on Amazon Web
                    Services.

                <p>
                    The heart of our website, the D3.js node graph, is dynamically populated with data loaded
                    asynchronously from the backend. We created a REST API which takes a set of query parameters and
                    fetches the required data from the Twitter API. You can see the REST API in action
                    <a href="http://129.213.158.149:4000/tweets?username=alan">here</a>.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">axios</a> library to handle AJAX calls to
                    the backend. Axios provides a clean and simple Promise-based interface, and integrates very
                    nicely with Vue.js (which also promotes the use of promises).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user searches for a Twitter username, a <code>GET</code> request is made to the
                    REST API and a Promise object is created. When the request is complete, the promise is resolved and
                    the data is passed to the node graph, which uses it to reinitialise itself and redraw the graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the final website, we plan to go even further with dynamically populated data by including
                    additional components which display statistics and other information about the current user.

                If we had to choose, we would probably go into greater depth on the database side and explore how we
                could visualise the results of the different graph search algorithms. We would be grateful for some
                guidance on how to maximise the depth section of the marks, based on the current context.
